# Storage Architectures


ðŸ”¹ DAS (Direct Attached Storage)

What it is:
Storage that is directly connected to a computer (like a hard drive or SSD connected via USB or SATA).

Key points:
	â€¢	No network involved â€“ itâ€™s local to the machine.
	â€¢	Fast access â€“ since itâ€™s directly attached.
	â€¢	Limited sharing â€“ typically used by one machine at a time.
	â€¢	Examples: Internal HDD/SSD, external USB drives.

Use cases:
Good for single-server setups, personal computers, or simple backup solutions.

ðŸ”¹ NAS (Network Attached Storage)

What it is:
A storage device connected to a network, accessible by multiple devices.

Key points:
	â€¢	File-level storage â€“ accessed using protocols like NFS, SMB/CIFS.
	â€¢	Easy sharing â€“ multiple users can access it over a network.
	â€¢	Often comes with its own OS â€“ with features like RAID, backups, etc.
	â€¢	Examples: Synology, QNAP, or any Linux box serving files via NFS/SMB.

Use cases:
Great for small to medium businesses or home networks where file sharing and central storage are needed.

ðŸ”¹ SAN (Storage Area Network)

What it is:
A dedicated high-speed network that provides block-level storage to servers.

Key points:
	â€¢	Block-level storage â€“ servers see it as a local disk (not a file share).
	â€¢	High performance â€“ uses protocols like iSCSI or Fibre Channel.
	â€¢	Complex and expensive â€“ often used in enterprise data centers.
	â€¢	Highly scalable and redundant.

Use cases:
Enterprise environments needing high-performance storage for databases, VMs, or mission-critical apps.
