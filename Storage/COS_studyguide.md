# üß† IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) and NetApp: How They Work Together

## üîÑ IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) vs NetApp

| Feature                     | IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)        | NetApp ONTAP / Storage               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Type of Storage**        | Object storage                         | File (NAS) / Block (SAN) storage     |
| **Best For**               | Unstructured data, backup, archives, cloud-native apps | Databases, VMs, containers, apps needing POSIX-compliant file access |
| **Protocol**               | S3 (API-based)                         | NFS, SMB (file); iSCSI, FC (block)   |
| **Where It Runs**          | IBM Cloud (public/private/hybrid)      | On-prem, hybrid, or cloud (via CVO or FSx for ONTAP) |
| **Integration with IBM Cloud** | Native                            | Integrated via IBM Cloud File Storage, and hybrid integrations |
| **Backup/Archiving Use**   | Primary use case                       | Often works in tandem with COS for tiering & archiving |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è How NetApp Works With COS

Even though COS and NetApp are different, they can complement each other:

### üîπ 1. Data Tiering from ONTAP to COS
- Using NetApp **FabricPool**, cold or infrequently accessed data can be automatically tiered from ONTAP to object storage ‚Äî including **IBM Cloud Object Storage**.
- This reduces the need to keep everything on expensive primary storage.

### üîπ 2. Backup/Archive
- ONTAP can replicate or archive snapshots to IBM COS as a backup layer.
- Trident and NetApp Astra (for Kubernetes) can back up to COS via plugins.

### üîπ 3. Hybrid Cloud Architectures
- Example: Apps run on-prem on NetApp (ONTAP), hot data stays on NetApp, cold/archive data lives in COS.
- Benefit: Fast performance locally and infinite scalability in the cloud.

## üß† As an SRE, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs Worth Learning

### üî∏ Learn the basics of IBM COS
- Bucket creation
- S3-compatible access
- Lifecycle policies (like auto-tiering or delete)

### üî∏ Understand NetApp FabricPool
- What it is, how tiering policies work
- Supported object storage (COS included!)

### üî∏ Explore Trident and Astra
- Especially if your role touches Kubernetes or OpenShift
